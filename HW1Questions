1. I did not really encounter many challenges while doing this assignment.
I had to import two functions from the math library, sqrt and isclose, in order to account for Right Isosceles triangles.

2. I thought that the requirements specifications for this project required me to think for a bit about how to correctly classify triangles and try to account for as many different types and combinations of dimensions as possible. 

3. The base Python tools were incapable of helping properly classify each case of triangle, which is why I needed to import two functions from the math library: sqrt and isclose.
I needed sqrt to check for Right Isosceles triangles, and the isclose function to check for Right Isosceles triangles in the if statements of the classify_triangle function.

4. To determine that I had sufficient test cases, I decided to make test cases to cover as many different cases of triangles that I could think of.
